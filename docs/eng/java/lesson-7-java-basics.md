# Java basics

Certainly, summarizing all of Java's syntax in a single response would be too extensive, but I can provide a high-level summary of the fundamental aspects of Java syntax:

## Basic Structure

- Java programs are organized into classes.
- A class consists of fields (variables) and methods (functions).
- Statements in Java typically end with a semicolon (`;`).

## Variables and Data Types

- Variables must be declared before use, specifying their data type.
- Common data types include `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
- Objects are instances of classes and can have complex data types.

[Details](/docs/eng/java/basis/variables-and-data-types.md)

## Control Flow

- Java supports conditional statements such as `if`, `else if`, and `else`.
- Looping is achieved using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` constructs.
- The `switch` statement is used for multi-way branching.

## Methods

- Methods define behavior and are declared within classes.
- The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program.
- Method parameters are specified within parentheses.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Java is an object-oriented language.
- Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are key OOP principles.
- Classes can extend other classes using the `extends` keyword.

## Arrays

- Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type.
- They are declared using square brackets (`[]`).

## Exception Handling

- Exceptions are used to handle runtime errors.
- `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks are used for exception handling.

## Packages and Imports

- Java classes are organized into packages.
- The `import` statement is used to include classes from other packages.

## Interfaces

- Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement.
- Multiple inheritance is achieved through interfaces.

## Modifiers

- Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`) control visibility. - Other modifiers include `static`, `final`, `abstract`, etc.

## File I/O

- Java supports file input and output operations through classes like `File`, `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, etc.
